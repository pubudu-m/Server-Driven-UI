What is Server-Driven UI?

Traditional mobile UI designs typically feature static layouts where UI elements are predefined and fixed within the app codebase. Any changes or updates to the UI require releasing new versions of the app, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome.

In contrast, Server-Driven UI is a way of designing mobile applications, where the entire UI is dynamically generated and provided by the server. This empowers developers to modify the UI without the need for app updates.
